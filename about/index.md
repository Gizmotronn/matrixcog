## About me
Hi there! My name is Liam (or Limo), and I'm a developer that makes robots and produces Youtube videos, primarily about the popular voxel-based game called Minecraft. I am working on a number of games at the moment, including a text-based role playing game called ["Pythons of Mars"](http://acord.tech/pom1) and a visual rpg called Star Sailors, which is based on a book that I'm writing. I'm working on a large space station in Minecraft, and you can see that [here](http://acord.tech/minecraft-spacestation). I also play other games on Youtube, like No Man's Sky, Space Engineers, & Starbound

I'm currently 16 and I take Computer Science, Ancient History, Chemistry, Math Specialist, Physics & Literature at school with the hopes of going to university and becoming a game designer or a robotics engineer. 

This website is a way for me to share my videos, my code and other cool stuff.
