# Background
In January 2016, I created my youtube channel. The first video I posted on it, The Steampunk Droids, currently has ~350 views on youtube and was basically a "highlights video" of building my first robot/droid, Sp-D2. I changed the name to Droidology in 2017, and that was the name it stayed as until March this year.

The reason for this was because I had already gotten into trouble when trying to trademark ACORD under its previous name "droid", as droid was trademarked by Disney. I asked one of my mates what I should switch the channel name to, and he came up with an answer right away -

>  You should call yourself "Limology"

And that was that. At least for 2 months, Limology was my title on Youtube. Until yesterday, when I determined that Limology wasn't:
*  Professional enough (as eventually it would be rebranded as part of the ACORD umbrella)
*  Cool enough (people like Iskall85, Rendog, etc had much better names, and I couldn't see myself getting into Hermitcraft with the name Limology)

The second reason was the most pressing at the time, but those were the 2 reasons why I decided to change the name.

# And the winner is...
> Hold on...I've got the best name!

You may know I'm working on a science fiction story called [Star Sailors](http://github.com/acord-robotics/starsailors). The main character in the book is called Opus. Opus is also the name of a robot in a beautiful mobile rpg. I decided Opus would be my name.

But Opus on its own wouldn't be enough. I'm not really a numbers person (unless we're talking sports), so I racked my brains to think about what I do on my channel. I showcase robots occasionally, and I often refer to myself as a "droid" (fair enough, considering my previous name). 

> What about "OpusTheRobot?"

And that was that.

# What's the plan for youtube
I'm going to be doing another post for this soon, but I will say this:
* We're going to have redstone showcases for Minecraft JAVA edition
* We're going to try and release 3 Mushlantis (Minecraft Bedrock Surival LP) episodes each month
* Just Cause 3, Starbound and other games will have episodes on average once a month
* In the holidays, we'll try and have 1 video each day. We have ~16 days, so that's 8 videos -
    * 4 Mushlantis episodes
    * 2 redstone showcases
    * 2 other videos
* In the summer holidays, we'll have 1 video every 2 days. 
* This means we could get 30-40 episodes of Mushlantis by the end of the year!
