# Introuction
I've been wondering about how I should make my Minecraft world look better. Since we're in a mushroom biome, we're surrounded by mycelium. I thought we could remove some of it, and replace it with grass. Here's what it's looking like, as well as some of our future build plans!

One of the things I've been trying to do is get more diamonds. Currently I have 3 diamond pickaxes (2 silk touch, 1 fortune 3), 1 diamond sword, 1 diamond shovel, and 1 diamond axe. I've also got a diamond chestplate and around 45 diamonds, but I want to keep those spare diamonds for when I create my nether/end armour sets and so on. I've therefore been going mining a lot (Episode 11), and in the upcoming episode 12 we raid 4 desert temples, coming away with 3 emeralds and 7 diamonds.

Here are the videos that are relevant to this post:

In this episode we collect a number of diamonds and iron from our mining trip and take another look at our trophy room.

In this episode I raid 4 desert temples, 1 shipwreck and find 1 set of buried treasure (and a few villages). This episode was originally going to be another mining episode, but I couldn't find any diamonds and I decided to try and find some temples. I travelled around 5000 blocks away from spawn to find those temples, and I eventually got back to the base via a nether portal that I created without a flint and steel, and without a fire charge. We also started working on terraforming the mushroom biome.

Mycelium is not the ugliest block (in fact, I like it a lot, which is one of the reasons why I love mushroom biomes), but I think Mushlantis would look a lot better with a grassy terrain. Even if the mycelium is removed, mobs will still not spawn, which means that I can mess with lighting (i.e. keep some areas in the dark).

The plan is to have some of the island mycelium - these would be called "conservation areas" and house pens of mooshrooms (possibly an XP grinder, however I have a zombie XP grinder I will be working on soon on the mushroom biome, which is the only location that dangerous/hostile mobs will spawn naturally). However, most of the island will be grass. I've inserted a few images here for examples of what others have done, and also what our world currently looks like. I'll update this post when the island is completely terraformed (and by completely, I mean mostly :)).

Brown mooshrooms (currently there are only red mooshrooms) are coming to Minecraft Bedrock soon. Mooshrooms spawn on mycelium, which is one of the reasons I want to keep it here (however I can still breed them). But on the version of Minecraft I'm playing with, brown mooshrooms don't exist yet. Since I've explored all of the island, all the chunks have been loaded, and that may mean that even when the brown guys are added they won't spawn. They apparently spawn when a red mooshroom is struck by lightning, so I need to make some sort of lightning trap. I'll build a base in the other mushroom islands and our current one (see below post)

Fortunately, there are 2 other mushroom islands that are close (<3000 blocks), and I won't explore those until the brown mooshrooms are added. I asked about it on [r/Minecraft](http://reddit.com/r/minecraft). Check out the post [here](http://reddit.com/u/LimoDroid)
