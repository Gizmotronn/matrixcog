# Introuction
I've been wondering about how I should make my Minecraft world look better. Since we're in a mushroom biome, we're surrounded by mycelium. I thought we could remove some of it, and replace it with grass. Here's what it's looking like, as well as some of our future build plans!

One of the things I've been trying to do is get more diamonds. Currently I have 3 diamond pickaxes (2 silk touch, 1 fortune 3), 1 diamond sword, 1 diamond shovel, and 1 diamond axe. I've also got a diamond chestplate and around 45 diamonds, but I want to keep those spare diamonds for when I create my nether/end armour sets and so on. I've therefore been going mining a lot (Episode 11), and in the upcoming episode 12 we raid 4 desert temples, coming away with 3 emeralds and 7 diamonds.

In this episode we collect a number of diamonds and iron from our mining trip and take another look at our trophy room.

__Episode 12__
In this episode I raid 4 desert temples, 1 shipwreck and find 1 set of buried treasure (and a few villages). This episode was originally going to be another mining episode, but I couldn't find any diamonds and I decided to try and find some temples. I travelled around 5000 blocks away from spawn to find those temples, and I eventually got back to the base via a nether portal that I created without a flint and steel, and without a fire charge. We also started working on terraforming the mushroom biome.
